# Hi, I'm Hamza Shahid! 👋

I'm a **Junior Flutter Developer** at **Teramob Technologies** with about 1 year of hands-on experience building production-ready mobile apps. I specialize in **clean architecture**, **offline-first systems**, **AI integration**, and delivering smooth, user-centered experiences that users love.

I've shipped multiple apps from concept to deployment, built Flutter packages for code reusability, and contributed to architecture decisions that make codebases scalable and maintainable.
